This bug occurs when using Tailwind CSS with a framework like Next.js or Nuxt.js.  The issue arises when trying to style a component using Tailwind classes, but the styles do not apply correctly. The problem might be that the Tailwind directives are not correctly configured in the project, especially the `purge` option in the `tailwind.config.js` file, which tells Tailwind which classes to include in the final CSS output. If it's too restrictive and doesn't include classes used in your components, the styles won't be applied.  Another possible reason is that the `@tailwind` directives in your CSS files (e.g., `globals.css`) are missing or placed incorrectly, preventing Tailwind from injecting its base styles and generating the necessary CSS.
