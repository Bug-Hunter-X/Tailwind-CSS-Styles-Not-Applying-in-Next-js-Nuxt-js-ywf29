# Tailwind CSS Styling Issue in Next.js/Nuxt.js

This repository demonstrates a common bug encountered when using Tailwind CSS within Next.js or Nuxt.js projects. The problem involves Tailwind classes not being applied correctly, leading to missing or unexpected styling.

## Bug Description

Styles defined using Tailwind CSS classes fail to render in the application. This issue often occurs due to problems with the Tailwind configuration, specifically the `purge` option or the placement of `@tailwind` directives.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run the development server: `npm run dev`
4. Observe that the styling is not applied correctly to the example component.

## Solution

The solution involves carefully reviewing the Tailwind configuration (`tailwind.config.js`) and ensuring correct placement of `@tailwind` directives in your CSS files. Refer to the `bugSolution.js` for the corrected code.
