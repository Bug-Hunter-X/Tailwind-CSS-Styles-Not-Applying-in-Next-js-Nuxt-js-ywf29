The solution involves correctly configuring the `tailwind.config.js` file and ensuring the `@tailwind` directives are in the correct place in your CSS file.  Here's an example of a corrected `tailwind.config.js`:

```javascript
/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [ 
    './pages/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
    './components/**/*.{js,ts,jsx,tsx}',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
}
```

This configuration ensures that Tailwind scans your pages and components for used classes.  The `content` option correctly identifies the paths of the project containing the necessary files to check.

Next, ensure that you've included the `@tailwind` directives in your main CSS file (e.g., `globals.css`):

```css
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

This imports all necessary Tailwind directives and allows the styles to be correctly applied.
